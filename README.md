# Mars Perseverance Rover Photos

This is a quick practice project I've been working on to sharpen my React workflow. By default, the application will render out the latest photos from the Mars Perseverance rover.

Users can use the menu to search through the entire photo history of each Mars rovers: Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance. Photos are sorted and searched by sol, which is how many Mars days passed since the rover landed on Mars. The user can then sort the photos by the camera names.

The app remains unfinished, but is live on [Netlify](https://react-mars-photo-app.netlify.app/).
